Firmware made for the STM32303RBT6 Microcontroller that consists of collecting data from the analog channels and some sensors via I2C.</br>

Almost every developing was made using CMSIS, TODO: Make a custom driver for I2C

The other two parts of the project are:</br>
* [STM32 Custom board](https://github.com/juamarCas/AnalogReader)
* [MQTT Middleware](https://github.com/juamarCas/MQTT_middleware/tree/develop)
